Character Growth
----------------

In Enderal, characters level up and grow in power through different means compared to Skyrim. Most of your experience points are going to come from completing quests and killing enemies rather than from making use of specific skills. If you are new to Enderal, the following section can help introduce you to some of the systems it changes involving character growth. If you have played Enderal before, and are only new to Somnium, then you can skip down to :ref:`growthSomniumLeveling` to see the changes we have made to Enderal's base systems.

.. _growth-reference-label:

Enderal Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enderal completely removes the Skills menu from Skyrim. You are no longer able to access the perk trees at all. Instead, you level your character up from a location known as the **Meditation Zone** which you can access by pressing **Y**.

Here you can find an assortment of pillars that act as the new perk trees. Each level gives the character 1 memory point which they can spend at these pillars to unlock a perk. 

Level ups also grant the player 5 skill points, and 4 crafting points, which they can use to raise their corresponding skills.

Your skill points can be spent to increase:

#. Fencing
#. Marksmanship
#. Pistols
#. Block
#. Heavy Armor
#. Light Armor
#. Sneak
#. Psionics
#. Elementalism
#. Mentalism
#. Entropy
#. Light Magic

Your crafting points can be spent to increase:

#. Alchemy
#. Sleight of Hand
#. Lockpicking
#. Enchanting
#. Handicraft
#. Rhetoric

In Somnium, the method to spend skill and crafting points has been altered from Enderal, where the player would spend their skill points reading books to improve said skills, and these changes will be covered in the following section.

.. _growthSomniumLeveling-reference-label:

Somnium Leveling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Somnium maintains most of Enderal's changes to leveling up and growing your character. The biggest change is made to the **Meditation Zone** and how you allocate your skill and crafting points. 

Instead of buying tiered books from select vendors, Somnium allows characters to spend their points directly in this space.

You can now do all the leveling you need from here. And, as a bonus, you are also able to completely refund all memory, skill, and crafting points from here so that you can try whichever build you would like and change it up if you want to try something new. Be aware that stripping your character of all their memories is a damaging process and will require the player to sacrifice some of their humanity.

.. _Affinities-reference-label:

Affinities
----------

In the base game, and even Forgotten Stories, the affinities available required characters to invest memory points into specific combinations of perk trees to earn an affinity. However, not all perk tree combinations would grant an affinity.

This is changed in Somnium. Now, regardless of the skills you perk into, you will achieve an affinity that will boost the potency of that build and make you stronger.

This allows for all kinds of new, interesting character archetypes to flourish against the harsh world they must face. With the ability to respec your character at any time, players are encouraged to experiment and find combinations that they really enjoy, just keep an eye on your own humanity in the process.

With version 1.2, a key change has been made to the Heavy Scout affinity, giving it a very unique bleed-based talent. If you have ever thought that bleeding damage in Enderal was boring or one dimensional, we encourage you to try out the new Heavy Scout.  You can earn this affinity by investing in Keeper and either Highwayman or Duelist.
